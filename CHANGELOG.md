# Changelog

All notable changes to the ADARE workspace. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) per package.

## Versioning policy

Each workspace package (`adare`, `adarevm`, `adarelib`, `adare-cv-server`) has its
own version in its `pyproject.toml`. While below 1.0, a **minor** bump marks a
breaking change and a **patch** bump everything else.

`adarelib` needs the most care: guests keep the `adarelib` they were provisioned
with, while testfunctions are uploaded fresh on every run. So:

- Anything a testfunction may rely on (decorator kwargs, `TestResult`, context
  API) is additive only within a minor series.
- Bump the `adarelib` minor version when that contract changes, and note under
  the release which guests need re-provisioning.

Agent wheels are built as `<version>+g<hash12>` of their sources, so a run
reinstalls `adarevm`/`adarelib` in the guest whenever their code changed; the
version above is still what marks a contract change.

Add entries under **Unreleased** as you go; on release, rename it to the version
and date, and tag the commit `<package>-v<version>` (e.g. `adarelib-v0.2.0`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Quality ratchet (`scripts/quality_ratchet.py`, `quality-baseline.json`): ruff
  and mypy violations plus files over 1000 lines are budgeted and may only shrink.
- CI `lint` job (format, strict mypy on `adare.core`, ratchet), weekly
  `pip-audit` workflow, Dependabot, and a coverage summary on the unit job.
- Pre-commit hooks (`make hooks`): ruff-format, ratchet, gitleaks, file checks.
- `make test`, `lint`, `lint-fix`, `lint-baseline`, `typecheck` targets.
- Import smoke test covering every host-package module.
- MIT license (Fraunhofer FKIE); `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` lists the NVIDIA-derived
  grounding server, which is excluded from it, and the bundled RBCmd.exe (MIT).
- `ADARE_HOME` relocates the whole state directory (default `~/.adare`); the unit
  suite runs against a temp dir and never touches the real one.
- `ADARE_FORWARD_BIND` sets the host address VM port forwards listen on.
- `ADARE_MCP_PORT` sets the `adare mcp serve --transport http` port.

### Changed
- Whole workspace formatted with `ruff format`; safe ruff autofixes applied.
- `uv.lock` is committed; CI installs with `--locked`.
- ruff and mypy pinned exactly in a `lint` dependency group.
- `adare mcp serve --transport http` defaults to port 13112 (was 13111, which the
  LocateAnything grounding server also uses).
- Guest agent wheels carry a content-hash version (`0.1.1+g<hash12>`); guests
  provisioned with a plain `0.1.1` reinstall the agent once on their next run.
- `make install`/`update` copy only what ADARE reads at runtime into
  `~/.adare/adare` and prune everything else (an existing copy shrinks from
  several GB to ~10 MB on the next `make update`).
- Importing `adare.config.configdirectory` no longer creates directories; the CLI
  and web API create them at startup.
- New `adare.services` functions must be fully typed (mypy override restored).

### Fixed
- Experiments started from chat (`experiment_run` tool) were cancelled
  immediately; they now run to completion.
- Changed `adarevm`/`adarelib` code never reached guests: the skip check compared
  unbumped static versions (and adarelib against adarevm's version).
- A testfunction collection needing a newer adarelib API suggested `uv add
  adarelib.…`; it now says the guest's adarelib is outdated.
- `except A or B` handlers that silently caught only `A` (8 places).
- `NameError` on error paths in the event listener and VirtualBox networking.
- Database APIs resolving their path at import time.
- Late-bound loop variables in the chunked file-pull progress callback.
- Unclosed file handles in network-drive setup and web-app upload.

### Security
- VM port forwards (QEMU hostfwd, VirtualBox NAT) listened on all interfaces,
  exposing the guest agent to the LAN; they now bind to 127.0.0.1.
- The guest agent no longer logs command environment values.
- Bumped 28 locked dependencies with published advisories (aiohttp, starlette,
  urllib3, cryptography, pyjwt, python-multipart, mcp, fastmcp, …).

### Removed
- Broken console scripts `adareexp` and `mcp_gui` (their modules no longer exist).
- Dead code: `networkdrive`, `helperfunctions.subprocess`, `webappaccess.request`,
  the experiment backup model, adarevm templating, legacy `setup.py` files and the
  root `requirements.txt`.
